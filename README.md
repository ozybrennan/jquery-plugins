# jquery-plugins

To better understand jquery plugins, I wrote a handful of simple plugins myself. Carousel allows the user to look through a slideshow of pictures; tabs opens information about a link when you click on it; thumbnails shows a larger version of a picture if you mouse over a smaller version; zoomable blows up a small part of a picture when you mouse over it. 

I'm particularly proud of the smooth transitions in my plugins. 

Zoomable is yet to be finished.
